# cubical-galois
A Constructive Formalization of Galois theory using the Cubical Agda proof assistant

Requires [the Cubical Agda standard library](https://github.com/agda/cubical) version 0.8, and Agda version 2.8.0

This is for my IB Personal Project.

Till now I have completely formalized (in `--safe` mode):
 - Definition of heyting fields, basic properties of heyting fields
 - Definition of field extensions
 - Subfields, intersection of subfields
 - Subextensions, intersection of subextensions
 - Morphisms of field extensions, identity and composition of morphisms
 - Automorphism group of a field extension
 - Fixed field of an automorphism of a field extension
 - Fixed field of a subgroup of the group of automorphisms
 - The degree of a polynomial, monic polynomials
 - Definition of differentiation of a polynomial
 - Algebraic field extensions

Feedback and constructive criticism is welcome!
